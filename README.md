## Installation
Install necessary dependecies using "npm i". Set up your .env file with your PostgresSQL username, password, and database name. Make sure you seed the database by using "npm run seed". After that you are good to go and can launch the server using "npm start".

## Usage
Once the server is running you can open up Insomnia and interact with the API routes for tags, categories, and products.

For Example:
- GET /api/tags: Retrieves all tags from the database.
- GET /api/tags/:id: Retrieves a tag by id from the database.
- POST /api/tags: Creates a new tag in the database.
- PUT /api/tags/:id: Updates a tag in the database.
- DELETE /api/tags/:id: Deletes a tag from the database.

This can also be used the same way for categories and products.
